Report Layout
1. Name, student number and project title on the first page of your project report.✅
2. A paragraph on the general description of your FSM [10].✅
3. A test bench and at least one module for your FSM. You can have more than two modules if your FSM requires it. Define the input and output of each module and a purpose/description of each state for each module. In your test bench, please put comments on how this will test your FSM. [20]✅(write comments)
4. A block diagram of FSM module(s). Please label all inputs and outputs. [10] ✅ (add link)
5. A block diagram of how the module(s) and test bench are connected. [10]✅ (add link)
6. A state diagram of your FSM with data flow. [10]✅ (add link)
7. A copy of your code (in Font Size 8) [10] [as a separate file]
8. Simulation waveform results [30].
